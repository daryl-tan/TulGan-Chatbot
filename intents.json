A â€˜S' grade is assigned if the student receives a â€˜C' grade or above for the module. Conversely, the student will receive a â€˜U' if the grade obtained is lower than a â€˜C' grade. Modular credits will be earned only if a â€˜Satisfactory' (S) grade is attained. <p class='botText'>For more information, please visit <a href='http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-activities/satisfactory-unsatisfactory-(s-u)-option'>http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-activities/satisfactory-unsatisfactory-(s-u)-option</a>"
